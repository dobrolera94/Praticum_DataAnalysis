## Introduction 
the project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

The report will be considered when building the **credit score** of a potential customer. The **credit score** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

### Goal
Test 4 hypotheses:
1. Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
2. Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
3. Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
4. How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

### Stages 
Data on  customers’ credit worthiness is stored in the file `/datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv`. There is no information about the quality of the data, so we will need to explore it before testing the hypotheses. 

First, we'll evaluate the quality of the data and see whether its issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will try to account for the most critical problems.
